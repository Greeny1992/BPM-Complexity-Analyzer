# BPM-Complexity-Analyzer

This project was developed as part of Georg Prassl's master's thesis at Joanneum University of Applied Sciences in Graz.

## Getting Started

To start the application, follow these steps:

1. Open a shell in the project root directory.

2. Run the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

3. After executing the command, the default web browser should open, displaying the running application.

4. The application features tab navigation. The first tab allows you to upload a BPMN file for analysis. Subsequent tabs provide descriptions for each metric.

5. The calculated metric will be displayed in the header of each tab.

In the `example-process` folder, you can find several sample BPMN processes to experiment with.
