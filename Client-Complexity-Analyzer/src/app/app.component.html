          <p>
            The metric "Count of Elements" is an important complexity metric in
            business process modeling. It allows evaluating the complexity of
            BPMN models. BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) is a
            standard notation for modeling business processes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The metric is based on the understanding that as the size and scope
            of a project increase, its complexity also grows. This holds true in
            software development, where the "Lines of Code" metric has been
            widely used to measure the complexity of computer programs. The
            larger and more complex a program becomes, the higher the likelihood
            of generating errors during development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gruhn and Laue suggest adapting the metric for BPMN models. Instead
            of counting lines of code, the metric counts the number of
            activities within a BPMN model. This provides a measurable value for
            evaluating and comparing the complexity of different models.
            However, they acknowledge that the number of activities alone does
            not capture the entire complexity, as it doesn't consider the
            control flow.
          </p>

          <p>
            To address this limitation, an extension of the metric is proposed.
            Rather than counting only activities, the metric counts all elements
            present in the BPMN model. This includes not only activities but
            also decision points, gateways, and other elements. Flow arrows are
            excluded from the count, as they don't significantly contribute to
            complexity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The formula for the Count of Elements (CoE) metric is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
        CoE(BPM) = |E_BPM|
    </pre
          >
          <p>
            Where CoE(BPM) represents the Count of Elements in a Business
            Process Model (BPM), and E is the set of all elements within the
            model. This extended metric provides a more comprehensive measure of
            complexity by considering the various elements that contribute to
            the overall complexity of a BPMN model.
          </p>

          <p>
            Further empirical research could validate the effectiveness of this
            metric and potentially provide guidelines to keep complexity within
            manageable limits during the modeling process.

            The McCabe cyclomatic complexity metric is a key measure in software
            development, introduced by McCabe to assess the understandability of
            software programs based on their control flow structures. It
            quantifies the number of possible paths that can be traversed in a
            control flow graph, with each binary decision (if-statement) adding
            one to the complexity count.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the context of business models and process modeling, Cardoso
            adapted the McCabe metric, focusing on paths originating from
            gateways. However, this adaptation considers only the splits
            mentioned in the relevant chapter, disregarding joins. The
            complexity of a process increases differently with each split in a
            graphical process model (BPM), leading to a Control Flow Complexity
            (CFC) score.
          </p>

          <p>The CFC score is calculated based on different types of splits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>AND Splits:</strong> These splits result in one state
              after convergence, as only one outgoing path is executed when all
              necessary input paths are reached.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>XOR Splits:</strong> Similar to AND splits, XOR splits
              allow only one outgoing path to be executed, but each specified
              state can be chosen, resulting in a CFC score equal to the number
              of possibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>OR Splits:</strong> OR splits have at least one and at
              most n possibilities for execution, increasing the CFC score by
              <em>(2^n) - 1</em>. However, the calculation must ensure that none
              of the outgoing paths is a default path, i.e., a path taken only
              if no other decision is made. A recommended calculation method is
              provided.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The adapted CFC score accounts for conditional paths, where
            activities with conditions on their outgoing paths are involved.
            Complex nested splits are not considered in this context but should
            be investigated in future research.
          </p>

          <p>
            The CFC scores for AND, XOR, and OR splits are summed up to
            calculate the overall control flow complexity for a BPM. It's
            important to note that this metric evaluates the mental load imposed
            on a modeler by examining the individual elements' states, rather
            than counting all possible paths in the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            A limitation of this metric is that it does not account for possible
            nesting, where nested constructs may increase complexity. However,
            this is not addressed in this work, as it assumes that models being
            analyzed are "well-structured," meaning that branches occur in pairs
            with correct nesting.

          <p>
            The original goal of the McCabe Metric is to represent the required
            test coverage in a program by capturing all possible paths in a
            program. This concept could also be of interest for Business Process
            Models (BPM). It allows the analysis of how many executable paths
            exist in a business process model. It is argued that the number of
            possible paths is related to the number of branches. As mentioned
            earlier, a high number of splits in a model indicates high
            complexity.
          </p>

          <p>
            When considering all possible paths in a model, meaning every path
            that can be followed from start to end event. In this case, the
            paths of the parallel branch can be considered as one path, as there
            is no nesting of further paths.
          </p>

          <p>
            This raises the question of whether it would be more meaningful to
            display the number of possible paths through a system for the
            complexity of the control flow. The previously presented number
            describes control flow complexity as the number of paths originating
            from splits, rather than the total number of possible paths in a
            system. As previously described, complexity increases with the
            number of elements, so it is reasonable to assume that the number of
            possible paths in a business process model is also a good indicator
            of complexity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, in addition to control flow complexity, a new metric is
            introduced. This metric represents all executable paths in a BPM.
            The metric is as follows:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>CoP(BPM) = Number of executable paths</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            The above metric represents the count of paths that can be executed
            in a BPM. It should be noted that parallel paths that do not contain
            further splits are considered as a single path.
          </p>

          <p>
            The cognitive complexity metric, or CCM, represents another
            significant approach to assessing complexity. Since complexity is
            influenced by a large part of subjective perception, Shao and Wang
            define weights for elements of software to quantify the cognitive
            weight of a model . This is intended to allow the quantification of
            the cognitive weight of a model, with the individual weights of the
            components being summed up.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gruhn adapts the weights developed by Shao for software complexity
            to business process models, providing a way to apply this concept to
            business processes. The weightings are as shown in Table 1.
          </p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Control Structure (BPMN)</th>
                <th>Control Structure (Software)</th>
                <th>Weight (BPMN)</th>

                <td>6</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>
            Table 1 provides a representation of cognitive weights for various
            control structures as defined by Gruhn. Additionally, the equivalent
            control structure in software development is presented.
          </p>

          <p>
            While Gruhn explains the detailed approach for deriving these
            weights, he also notes that these weightings have not been
            empirically tested. In contrast, Shao and Wang refer to verified
            values .
          </p>

          <p>
            It can be said that the cognitive complexity metric by Shao and Wang
            provides a good foundation, but the adaptation to business process
            models is not a trivial process. For this work, Gruhn's weightings
            for the prototype development are nevertheless used.
          </p>

          <p>
            To mitigate the weaknesses of these values, users should be able to
            change the values in the future. This should be done because
            different users would weight the individual control structures
            differently. Since the scope of an empirical testing of weightings
            in this work is not sufficient, this provides an opportunity to
            change the values and identify potential correlations with other
            metrics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another point to note concerns the sequences defined by Gruhn for
            business models. It is not described when a sequence is defined as a
            sequence. It could be assumed that every path in a model can be
            described as a sequence. However, this would not align with the
            defined weight. With a weight of one, it suggests that a sequence is
            very easy to understand. Therefore, a better interpretation would be
            that a sequence is considered as a series of activities without
            interruption. This interpretation would also better align with
            Gruhn's defined weight, as a series of activities without branching
            is the easiest-to-understand structure.

          <p>
            The Fan-In/Fan-Out metric is also a metric from software development
            developed by Sallie. It is used to assess the dependencies and
            complexity of modules or functions within a program.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fan-In refers to the number of functions that access a specific
            unit. In the context of a program, these units can be methods or
            classes . This measures how many other parts of the program depend
            on one unit. High Fan-In values indicate that the unit is reusable
            and well integrated into the rest of the program. Applied to
            business process models, a high Fan-In value means that many other
            processes or activities refer to this one process, indicating its
            significant or central role in the overall flow .
          </p>

          <p>
            Fan-Out describes the opposite, which is the number of different
            elements called by a specific unit. A high Fan-Out can be an
            indication that a program has high complexity due to numerous
            dependencies or performing many different tasks . Processes with a
            high Fan-Out value suggest a complex process structure where many
            different activities or subprocesses are required to achieve the
            desired outcome.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another aspect that can be considered in this metric is a study from
            psychology. It is noted that human cognitive capacity for processing
            information is limited, and on average, people can retain about
            seven (plus or minus two) units of information in working memory.
            This means that we typically can remember about five to nine units
            of information before our ability to process and remember accurately
            diminishes .
          </p>

          <p>
            Under this consideration, one could argue that a Fan-Out number
            greater than seven (plus or minus two) is a poor value for cognitive
            complexity because the modeling person must also remember these
            subprocesses in their memory.
          </p>

          <p>Henry describes the calculation of the metric as follows :</p>

          <p>fifo(BPM)=(FanIn*FanOut)^2</p>

          <p>
            The formula shows that the FIFO value of a BPM is the square of the
            product of Fan-In (process calls) and Fan-Out (subprocess calls).
          </p>

          <p>
            The application to BPMN models is generally possible, but the
            question arises as to what should be measured as Fan-In (process
            call). When applying this metric to a single process, process calls
            are not directly known. In a model, a process call would be an
            incoming message if the start event is a message start event.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, an alternative approach would be to use start events for
            this calculation. Each start event is an opportunity to call a
            process. Based on this consideration, a process with a single start
            event has a Fan-In value of one, a process with two start events has
            a Fan-In value of two, and so on. This approach is used in this work
            but also focuses more on the Fan-Out values since the Fan-Out value
            provides a more significant value for perceived process complexity
            than the Fan-In value (in relation to the previously mentioned
            "seven (plus/minus two)" rule).
          </p>

          <p>
            This calculation can be directly applied to BPMN and, thus, can help
            identify defects in modularization. This can assist in designing
            leaner and more maintainable processes.

          <p>
            The Halstead metrics are one of the most well-known and oldest
            complexity metrics in software development. They involve an analysis
            of the source code, evaluating the number of operators and operands.
            Three metrics are calculated: program length, program volume, and
            program difficulty. The use of these metrics has the advantage that
            no detailed analysis of program structures is required .
          </p>

          <p>The following elements are used in the calculation:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><code>n1</code>: Number of distinct operators</li>
            <li><code>n2</code>: Number of distinct operands</li>
            <li><code>N1</code>: Total number of operators</li>
            <li><code>N2</code>: Total number of operands</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With these elements, the Halstead metrics can be calculated as
            follows :
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Program Length:
              <p>N(BPM)= n1*log_2(n1) + n2*log_2(n2)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Program Volume:
              <p>V(BPM)= (N1+N2)*log_2(n1+n2)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Program Difficulty:
              <p>D(BPM) = (n1/2)*(N2/n2)</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Before these metrics can be applied, it must be defined what
            constitutes an operator and an operand. In software development,
            this can vary depending on the programming language used. Therefore,
            this metric is widely applicable since it can be applied to all
            languages. In software development, examples of operators include
            'if,' 'else,' 'for,' and 'return,' while variables are considered
            operands .
          </p>

          <p>
            However, after considering these metrics, the question arises as to
            how they should be applied to BPMN models. Operators do not present
            a difficulty in this context. For instance, activities and splits
            can be considered operators as they closely resemble constructs from
            software development. On the other hand, it is not straightforward
            to determine what constitutes various operands.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since BPMN 2.0, elements like Data Objects, Data Inputs, Data
            Outputs, and Data Stores have been introduced, allowing the modeling
            of data and data flows <cite>[Silver_2011]</cite>. Consequently,
            these elements can represent operands and complete the Halstead
            metrics. In Table <a href="#tab:halstead">1</a>, the respective
            operators and operands for this work are defined.
          </p>

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Operators</th>
              <th>Operands</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Activities</td>
              <td>Data Objects</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Splits</td>
              <td>Databases</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Events</td>
              <td>-</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Subprocesses</td>
              <td>-</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>
            The Halstead software metrics have both advantages and
            disadvantages. Positively, they effectively capture the frequency of
            programming errors and strongly correlate with them. They are also
            usable across different programming languages and can be applied to
            BPMN models.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, they have the disadvantage of only considering a part of
            the development process, namely the translation of design into
            source code, while ignoring other significant factors like nesting
            depth or name scope. Additionally, there are ambiguities in their
            approach, particularly in the not clearly defined classification of
            operands and operators, which can strongly influence the results.
